\title{Split a tibble of symbols into batches}
\usage{
split_batch(symbol_list, batch_size = 25)
}
\arguments{
\item{symbol_list}{A tibble containing at least a column \code{symbol}. Typically output from \code{fetch_symbols()}.}

\item{batch_size}{An integer indicating the maximum number of rows per batch. Default is 25.}
}
\value{
A list of tibbles, each containing up to \code{batch_size} symbols.
}
\description{
This function splits a tibble into a list of smaller tibbles, each containing up to \code{batch_size} rows.
}
\details{
Batching is important because querying too many symbols at once from external APIs (like Yahoo Finance)
can lead to:
\itemize{
\item API rate limits being exceeded,
\item Timeout errors,
\item Partial or corrupted data responses.
}

By splitting requests into manageable batches, we ensure more stable API calls, reduce failure rates,
and improve overall pipeline reliability.
